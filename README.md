#DESCRIPTION
In this project, I have made a simple AI-based recommendation system using only core Java.
The aim of this project is to show how basic recommendation systems work internally.
A recommendation system is used to suggest products, movies, or songs to users based on their preferences or similarities with other users.
Big companies like Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube use these techniques to show us what we might like next. 

In this Java project:
I have created a few users (Gulnawaj, Ravi, Sara) and stored their movie ratings in a HashMap.
For example, Gulnawaj has rated movies like Avengers, Spiderman, and Batman.
I also created a new user with some initial movie ratings.
The program finds which existing user is most similar to the new user.
To find similarity, I used a simple dot product logic — if two users have given similar ratings to same movies, they are treated as similar.
After finding the most similar user, the system recommends new movies that the new user hasn’t rated but the similar user has.
